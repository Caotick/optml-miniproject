This project is part of the CS-439 course: Optimization for Machine Learning. The repository contains the code that was used to write our paper.
 
## Project title
SGD, AdaGrad, Adam: Comparisons between optimization algorithms on classic problems

## Datasets

* Pima Indian Diabetes Database: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
* California Housing: https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices
* Fashion MNIST (automatically downloaded if necessary when running project)

In order to reproduce the paper, the first two datasets should be downloaded manually and placed into a ```/data``` folder at the root of the project.

A ```main.py``` file can be run from the terminal with the command ```python main.py```

This will do the following:
* Create the complete folder structure to save the losses, accuracies and graphs from the different models with the different optimizers in the data folder.
* Download automatically the FashionMNIST dataset in case it is not already in the ```/data``` folder.
* Build the different networks according to each problem as describe in the paper.
* Print the losses and accuracy at each epoch for the 10 folds for each model.
* Generate the graphs and print the best results from the data generated from all the models which is saved in the data folders.

Note: Running this code took a bit less than an hour with a computer equipped with a NVIDIA GTX980GPU and 16 GB RAM
